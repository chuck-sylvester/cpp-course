Section 19 
Challenge 1 

Formatting output
===========================================================================================
I have provided you with the starter source code for this challenge.

In this challenge you are to display the provided data in a nicely formatted table.
Your table does not have to match mine, but practice with the format manipulators
so you become comfortable with them.

There are 3 structures provided. These could also be classes with public data, but
it's common to use structures when we simply want to model data only.

The structures work together to create a Tours structure that will contain information
about Tours to South America. The Tours include Countries, Cities within those countries
along with population and cost data for each city tour.

Please watch the Challenge video for the expected output.

In the provided source code I'm giving you some code that displays the data from the
structures and the vectors within the structures. This code uses tabs to format the data
and it looks pretty ugly.

Have fun!! Create functions if you like, use constants, whatever you think makes sense!
